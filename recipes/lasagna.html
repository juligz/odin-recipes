    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna (in Italian, lasagna) is a type of pasta. It's usually served in overlapping sheets interspersed with layers of ingredients of your choice, most often meat (ragu) in a Bolognese and béchamel sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>600 g beef for stewing</li>
        <li>300 g pork belly</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>1 celery branch</li>
        <li>200 ml red wine</li>
        <li>800 g peeled tomatoes or tomato sauce</li>
        <li>50 ml milk</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bechamel</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>80 g mantequilla</li>
        <li>80 g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>750 ml leche</li>
        <li>nutmeg to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>200 g Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We cut the bacon into small squares. But first, we remove the skin because it's very tough.</li>
        <li>We put the bacon on medium heat so that it cooks slowly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cut the vegetables into small squares.</li>
        <li>We didn't forget to stir the bacon!</li>
        <li>Add a splash of oil to the pan with the bacon, preferably olive oil.</li>
        <li>And we add the vegetables.</li>
        <li>We add 1 pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>And, over medium-low heat, we cook until the onion, carrot and celery soften.</li>
        <li>We add the beef.</li>
        <li>We make the heat medium high and stir very well.</li>
        <li>Once the meat has changed color, add 1 glass of red wine.</li>
        <li>We cook until the alcohol evaporates.</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce or chopped tomatoes. I'm going to use whole canned tomatoes, but you can use any tomato sauce you like.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce has started to boil, we reduce the heat to low and put the lid on, leaving a gap for the steam to escape.
        </li>
        <li>The sauce should be cooked for 2 to 4 hours. Simmer very slowly. If it seems dry, add a little more water or broth.</li>
        <li>It took me 3 hours to cook the sauce.</li>
        <li>Season it to your liking.</li>
        <li>Add milk to balance the acidity.</li>
        <li>The sauce is ready.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Bechamel</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make bechamel, melt the butter.</li>
        <li>Add the flour.</li>
        <li>Sauté the flour for 2-3 minutes over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the cold milk and turn the heat up to high.</li>
        <li>Stir very well. The flour dissolves very well in cold milk.</li>
        <li>The béchamel sauce must be stirred constantly until it thickens. </li>
        <li>As soon as it starts to boil, we reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2-3 more minutes.</li>
        <li>We remove the bechamel from the heat.</li>
        <li>And we season it. We add a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Shall.</li>
        <li>And a little ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>To prevent a crust from forming, I cover it with a piece of plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>We grate the parmesan or parmigiano.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180ºC or 360ºF with top and bottom heat.
        </li>
        <li>Grease the mold or baking dish with butter. My mold measures 24x24x6.5 cm.</li>
        <li>Cover the bottom with the bechamel.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of pasta on top.</li>
        <li>The ragù or meat sauce goes on top of the pasta.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the ragù with a little béchamel.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parmesan.</li>
        <li>Again we add pasta, ragù, béchamel, parmesan and so on until the mold is full.</li>
        <li>We generously cover the last layer with bechamel and sprinkle generously with cheese.</li>
        <li>We bake the lasagna for 45 minutes, the last 5 minutes on the grill at 250ºC.
        </li>
        <li>Before serving, let it rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
