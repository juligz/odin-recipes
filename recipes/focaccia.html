    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Focaccia, that flat, dimpled Italian bread generously flavored with olive oil, is found all over Italy and varies from place to place. I was torn about which type of focaccia to share, but ultimately settled on this particularly well-known focaccia barese, from southern Italy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5g sugar</li>
        <li>500g wheat flour</li>
        <li>9g baking powder</li>
        <li>50 cm3 olive oil</li>
        <li>325 cm3 water</li>
        <li>10g shall</li>
        <li>coarse salt</li>
        <li>tomate cherry</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>black olives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On the work table, make a fountain with the flour and salt on the edges.</li>
        <li>Add yeast and sugar in the center and hydrate it with a little water.</li>
        <li>Form a dough by adding water whenever necessary.</li>
        <li>Once there are no traces of flour , add the olive oil and continue kneading until the dough absorbs it completely.</li>
        <li>Add a little more water if necessary, you should achieve a fairly moist and homogeneous dough.</li>
        <li>Let it ferment in a bowl with olive oil and cover with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Wait until the dough has doubled in size and divide into 2 portions.</li>
        <li>Roll out each piece of dough and place it on a greased baking sheet, brushing it with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Allow a second fermentation.</li>
        <li>Pierce with your fingertips and top with the tomatoes, black olives, garlic with skin, rosemary , and more olive oil, then sprinkle with coarse salt.</li>
        <li>Let it rest for 20 minutes on the tray before baking.</li>
        <li>Bake at 220Â° C for 12 minutes until the crust is golden.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove from the tray so that the base does not remain wet.</li>
    </ol>
